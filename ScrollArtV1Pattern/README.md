## 1. Triangle Hall

`ScrollArtV1Pattern.java` is a program that prints straight lines moving either left or right. 
Then a new line, at random intervals, branches off an existing line in the opposite direction. 
It creates a pattern that looks like a bunch of triangles. I was inspired by watching Al Sweigart's Scroll Art video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjk4UMpJqVs&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fscrollart.org%2F&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjM4NTE).

## 2. Text-moji Art 

My text-moji art is in `ScrollArtV1.java`.
I was inspired by the bunny textmoji from a Google search of "bunny ascii emoticon" (credit: belongs to the internet it seems like):

It was only 8x3 so I added a rocket detailing to it.

I decided to make a 8x6 carrot after I made this bunny rocket. Here is the carrot: 
```
     \)/
    --v 
   /r )
  >r./
 / '  
c_/   if
```

#### Process 
This carrot came from my head. I wrote out the carrot on an index card first. On the right is the carrot, and then I made a grid to fit it.

Then I input each individual character into its 2D location into Image.java, in the `getImage()` function.
